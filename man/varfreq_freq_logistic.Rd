\title{Function to calculate observed variant prevalence at time t given logistic growth (PDF)}
\usage{
varfreq_freq_logistic(t, p0, r, c_ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{time step number (e.g., days) at which to calculate prevalence}

\item{p0}{initial variant prevalence (# introductions / infected population size)}

\item{r}{logistic growth rate}

\item{c_ratio}{coefficient of detection ratio, calculated as the ratio of the coefficients of variant 1 to variant 2; default = 1 (no bias)}
}
\value{
scalar giving the variant prevalence at time t
}
