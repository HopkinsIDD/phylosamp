gen_dist_sim
}
\description{
This data object contains the genetic distance distributions
for 168 values of \eqn{R} between 1.3 and 18. The distributions represent the
the average of 1000 simulations for each value, which can be used as a
reasonable proxy for the generation distribution for large outbreaks.
