\title{Function to calculate the coefficient of detection ratio for two variants}
\usage{
vartrack_cod_ratio(
  phi_v1 = 1,
  phi_v2 = 1,
  gamma_v1 = 1,
  gamma_v2 = 1,
  alpha_v1 = 1,
  alpha_v2 = 1,
  beta_a = 1,
  beta_s = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phi_v1}{probability that a tested infection caused by variant 1 results in a positive test (sensitivity)}

\item{phi_v2}{probability that a tested infection caused by variant 2 results in a positive test (sensitivity)}

\item{gamma_v1}{probability that a detected infection caused by variant 1 meets some quality threshold}

\item{gamma_v2}{probability that a detected infection caused by variant 2 meets some quality threshold}

\item{alpha_v1}{probability that an infection caused by variant 1 is asymptomatic}

\item{alpha_v2}{probability that an infection caused by variant 2 is asymptomatic}

\item{beta_a}{probability of testing an asymptomatic infection (any variant); note that this parameter is not required if alpha_v1==alpha_v2}

\item{beta_s}{probability of testing a symptomatic infection (any variant); note that this parameter is not required if alpha_v1==alpha_v2}
}
\value{
scalar giving the multiplicative bias of variant 1
}
\description{
This function calculates the coefficient of detection ratio \eqn{C_{V_1}/C_{V_2}} for two variants.
This function assumes that variant 1 is the variant of concern (VOC).
This function is specific to the two-variant system.
Parameters not provided are assumed to be equivalent between the two variants.
